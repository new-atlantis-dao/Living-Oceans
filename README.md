# ðŸª™[`Check Out Our GitCoin Grant!`](https://gitcoin.co/grants/7126/new-atlantis-unlocking-marine-biodiversity-blue-c)ðŸª™

`Gitcoin` is a platform where coders and developers can get paid to work on open-source software in a wide variety of programming languages. Users can also submit their own project ideas to the `Gitcoin` platform in order to crowdsource funding from contributing donors. Aside from direct community crowdfunding, `Gitcoin` employs a unique system known as quadratic funding to help match community funding efforts to accelerate development of the projects the community deems most popular. All in all, `Gitcoin` is a platform designed to foster the development of meaningful, open-source projects and better align the interests of donors and developers.

# ðŸŒŠ `Living Oceans Project`
`New Atlantis` is an open ocean regeneration project that seeks to address biodiversity loss in our oceans by providing a viable business model to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).  We do this by building an open marine biodiversity analytics platform to monitor and forecast the health of Marine Protected Areas and from which marine biocredits and blue carbon credits can be generated.  



These credits form the basis of a marine biodiversity market where MPAs can sell credits generated based on the biodiversity, biomass abundance, and life-driven blue carbon in their waters.    This market provides MPAs with sustainable revenue streams that grow as conservation efforts and positive ecological outcomes increase.  By providing MPAs with a viable business model that aligns with their core mission of ocean protection, `New Atlantis` can help scale marine biodiversity protection efforts worldwide while also enabling massive new markets for ocean ecological assets.  



We are using DeSci-driven metagenomics and related ecological modeling techniques combined with leading edge regenerative finance and web3 collaboration tools to build out the foundation of our open marine biodiversity analytics platform.  



We know this is an enormous, ambitious undertaking.  We don't think we can do this alone.  So we are developing an open, collaborative platform that rewards meaningful contributions from ocean science, ReFi, DeSci (ReSci!!), conservation, and indigenous communities,  as well as from ocean-concerned citizens.  `New Atlantis` believes there is an opportunity to harness the collective intelligence of the global ocean community to align profit incentives with the protection + regeneration of the global marine biosphere.  



Our goal is to make investing in the protection and expansion of sustainable marine ecosystems an extremely profitable global growth opportunity that can generate financial wealth for humans by improving the ecological health of the oceans.  



We invite the global ocean community to come collaborate with us on Twitter or Discord

## ðŸ—º Road Map

The `New Atlantis` living ocean protocol will provide an open, globally scalable marine biodiversity analytics and forecasting framework. `New Atlantis` will provide the foundational infrastructure and modular design approach that facilitates open source development, incentivizes community contribution to build collective ocean intelligence, and enables integration of related ocean sciences data + models (ie GIS, metabolomics, proteomics, biogeochemistry, etc)



Phase one of the Living Ocean Protocol is the `New Atlantis` Metagenome Pipeline Assembly as a platform for scalable marine ecosystem profiling and related ocean analytics + forecasting tools.



* **Phase 1: METAGENOME ASSEMBLY PIPELINE beta- (completed)**  Assess baseline biodiversity of an ecosystem using eDNA (metabarcoding [MTB] and/or metagenomic [MTG] sequencing) data to develop the planktonic taxonomic profile of an ecosystem. This tells us what plankton species are present in what relative abundance.  See the output from the NA MTG Pipeline in Figure 1.  See our GitHub for details and to check out our collab workbooks.


* **Phase 2: EXPANDING DATASETS/TIME SERIES + ADDING SPECIES-LEVEL MODELS:** Add datasets and models focused on the functional traits of individual  species within an ecosystem; enable 3rd party dataset + model pipeline additions.  Productionize direct data collection pipelines.  Begin open development of quantifying marine biodiversity and development of baseline metrics.  
 

* **Phase 3: INTEGRATING MODELS INTO METAGENOME METAMODEL:** Build food web models using  taxonomies + functional traits across species and time.  These models will be both used to gauge ecosystem health (ie preventative health screenings for MPAs) and to make projections about the future growth of those ecosystems.  Expand work on biodiversity metrics including open development of a marine biodiversity unit of account.
 

* **Phase 4: LIVING OCEANS PROTOCOL MODULAR PLATFORM:** enable an open marine data protocol + access to ecological models for broad ocean analytics and/or integration of related modular datasets + models (ie GIS, metabolomics, etc).  Enable cryptoeconomic incentives to encourage 3rd party contribution of datasets and models into `New Atlantis` Living Oceans Protocol metamodel.  Continuous improvement in biodiversity forecasting + granularity, expanded biodiversity tokenomics.
 

* **Phase 5: MARINE BIODIVERSITY MARKETS:** launch $BLU marine biodiversity token, enable MPAs to generate revenues/tokens by quantifying- and valuing- the life and blue carbon in their areas.  Enable profitable participation by the global ocean community in biodiversity markets/ tokenomics in exchange for providing relevant datasets, models, capital, and conservation work + outcomes.
