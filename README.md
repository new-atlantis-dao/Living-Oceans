`Gitcoin` is a platform where coders and developers can get paid to work on open-source software in a wide variety of programming languages. Users can also submit their own project ideas to the `Gitcoin` platform in order to crowdsource funding from contributing donors. Aside from direct community crowdfunding, `Gitcoin` employs a unique system known as quadratic funding to help match community funding efforts to accelerate development of the projects the community deems most popular. All in all, `Gitcoin` is a platform designed to foster the development of meaningful, open-source projects and better align the interests of donors and developers.

`New Atlantis` is an open ocean regeneration project that seeks to address biodiversity loss in our oceans by providing a viable business model to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).  We do this by building an open marine biodiversity analytics platform to monitor and forecast the health of Marine Protected Areas and from which marine biocredits and blue carbon credits can be generated.
